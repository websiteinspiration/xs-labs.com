   More than a year passed since my last post, and since I announced that I was leaving my position as the lead developer of <a href="https://imazing.com/" title="iMazing">iMazing</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Well, it did not last long, as I was in fact hired back in May 2015, at the exact same position.<br />
    And obviously, I've been pretty busy since then, hence the lack of updates on this site.
